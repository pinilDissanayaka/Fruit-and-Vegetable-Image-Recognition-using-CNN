# Fruit-and-Vegetable-Image-Recognition-using-CNN

The Fruit and Vegetable Image Recognition System is a computer vision application developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify and identify a diverse range of fruits and vegetables. This system is designed to accurately identify and categorize 27 different food items, including various fruits and vegetables.

The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model includes images of the following fruits: banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, and mango. Additionally, it includes images of an array of vegetables, such as cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, radish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soybean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chili pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalape√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, and eggplant.

The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques and a deep learning architecture to analyze and distinguish these fruits and vegetables based on their unique visual features. Users can simply input an image of a fruit or vegetable, and the system will provide accurate and fast recognition, indicating the specific food item it has detected.

This image recognition system is a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including food industry quality control, dietary and nutritional tracking, agriculture, and consumer-facing mobile apps, where it can help users identify and learn more about the fruits and vegetables they encounter in their daily lives. Additionally, it can be used to create data-driven insights about the availability and popularity of various food items in different regions, aiding in market research and decision-making processes.
